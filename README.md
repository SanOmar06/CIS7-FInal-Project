Project Information and Details
The goal of this project was to build and implement a complete Blackjack game using C++. Many beginner projects struggle with logic for decision making, probability based outcomes and tracking across multiple rounds. To combat this, the project began with structure and rule accurate Blackjack game play against a computer controlled dealer.
